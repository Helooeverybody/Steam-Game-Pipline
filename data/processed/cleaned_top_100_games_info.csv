Keep an eye out for regular seasonal events, as there’s always something interesting or dangerous (or both) happening on the island.; Updates to the game include:; Procedurally generated worlds with community map editor support; Host your own servers and with server - side modding support; Transportation: horses, modular cars, hot air balloons, helicopters, bikes, trains, boats, and more; Complex electrical, farming and automation systems; Base Building and Raiding; New factions, enemies, and wildlife; New monuments, terrain, and areas to explore; Advanced underwater areas to discover; Musical instruments and the ability to perform to players; Large overground and underground train networks; Massive recent graphics upgrade and environment overhaul; New for 2025 - The Primitive Update - Featuring new Siege Weapons, Shields, and a new game mode; . . . and much more EXPLORE; You wake naked on a mysterious island, armed only with a rock and a torch. You’ll need to brave environmental dangers and deficiencies (from heat and cold to thirst and starvation), build a shelter, eat (or be eaten), and scavenge materials. Explore the island and its abandoned settlements, mysterious monuments, and the factions that occupy them. But, above all, watch out for other survivors… BUILD Design and build bases to store your loot, defend your territory, and control the resources of the island. Research the tech tree, grow farms, command electricity, and commandeer various forms of transportation to traverse the island. Whatever it takes to get ahead. SURVIVE There are no rules in Rust but the ones you make for yourself. Craft tools, armour, and weapons to defend yourself. Cooperate with friends, make alliances, and build a settlement together. Explore the island and what’s happening in it, trade with other players, or prey on them, raiding their bases and taking their hard - won goods.","The only aim in Rust is to survive. Everything wants you to die - the island’s wildlife, other inhabitants, the environment, and other survivors. Do whatever it takes to last another night.","English , French , Italian , German , Spanish - Spain , Japanese , Korean , Russian , Simplified Chinese , Ukrainian , Polish , Portuguese - Portugal , Turkish , Arabic, Czech, Danish, Dutch, Finnish, Greek, Norwegian, Portuguese - Brazil, Spanish - Latin America, Swedish, Traditional Chinese, Vietnamese; languages with full audio support",[47000000],"['Multi-player', 'MMO', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'Co-op', 'Online Co-op', 'Cross-Platform Multiplayer', 'Steam Achievements', 'Steam Trading Cards', 'Steam Workshop', 'In-App Purchases', 'Valve Anti-Cheat enabled', 'Stats', 'Remote Play on Tablet']","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Indie', 'Massively Multiplayer', 'RPG']","['Official Trailer', 'The Primitive Update', 'Scrap Helicopter', 'Excavator', 'World Update 2.0']",92,"['Place Camp Fire', 'Craft Camp Fire', 'Collect Wood', 'Craft Stone Hatchet', 'Collect 200 Stone', 'Craft Stone Pickaxe', 'Place Sleeping Bag', 'Collect 700 Wood', 'Craft Spear', 'Craft Sleeping Bag']",False,2018-02-08,32,470.000₫,True,True,False,1055345,Minimum:; Requires a 64 - bit processor and operating system; OS: Windows 10 64bit; Processor: Intel Core i5 - 8250U / AMD Ryzen 5 5500 or better; Memory: 10 GB RAM; Graphics: GTX 1050 / AMD 500 Series or better; DirectX: Version 11; Network: Broadband Internet connection; Storage: 40 GB available space; Additional Notes: SSD is highly recommended or expect longer than average load times.,Minimum:; OS: macOS Monterey (version 12); Processor: Apple M1; Memory: 10 GB RAM; Graphics: Apple M1; Network: Broadband Internet connection; Storage: 40 GB available space,Minimum:; Processor: Intel Core i7 - 3770 / AMD FX - 9590 or better; Memory: 8 GB RAM; Graphics: GTX 670 2GB / AMD R9 280 better; Network: Broadband Internet connection; Storage: 10 GB available space,Recommended:; Requires a 64 - bit processor and operating system; OS: Windows 11 64bit; Processor: Intel Core i7 - 4790K / AMD Ryzen 5 2600 or better; Memory: 16 GB RAM; Graphics: RTX 3060 / RX 570 Series or better; DirectX: Version 12; Network: Broadband Internet connection; Storage: 40 GB available space; Additional Notes: SSD Required,Recommended:; OS: macOS Monterey (version 12); Processor: Apple M1 Pro / Max / Ultra; Memory: 16 GB RAM; Graphics: Apple M1 Pro / Max / Ultra; Network: Broadband Internet connection; Storage: 40 GB available space,Recommended:; Processor: Intel Core i7 - 4690K / AMD Ryzen 5 1600; Memory: 16 GB RAM; Graphics: GTX 980 / AMD R9 Fury; Network: Broadband Internet connection; Storage: 12 GB available space,"esrb: (required_age=17, descriptors=) | pegi: (required_age=17, descriptors=) | bbfc: (required_age=17, descriptors=) | usk: (required_age=17, descriptors=) | oflc: (required_age=17, descriptors=) | nzoflc: (required_age=17, descriptors=) | cero: (required_age=17, descriptors=) | dejus: (required_age=18, descriptors=Violência fantasiosa Violência Medo Linguagem imprópria Nudez) | mda: (required_age=17, descriptors=) | fpb: (required_age=17, descriptors=) | csrr: (required_age=17, descriptors=) | crl: (required_age=17, descriptors=) | kgrb: (required_age=18, descriptors=) | steam_germany: (required_age=16, descriptors=Drastische Gewalt)"

Trapped forever in a realm of eldritch evil where even death is not an escape, four determined Survivors face a bloodthirsty Killer in a vicious game of nerve and wits. Pick a side and step into a world of tension and terror with horror gaming's best asymmetrical multiplayer. Survivors play in third - person and have the advantage of better situational awareness. The Killer plays in first - person and is more focused on their prey. The Survivors' goal in each encounter is to escape the Killing Ground without getting caught by the Killer - something that sounds easier than it is, especially when the environment changes every time you play. Key Features • Survive Together… Or Not - Survivors can either cooperate with the others or be selfish. Your chance of survival will vary depending on whether you work together as a team or if you go at it alone. Will you be able to outwit the Killer and escape their Killing Ground? • Where Am I? - Each level is procedurally generated, so you’ll never know what to expect. Random spawn points mean you will never feel safe as the world and its danger change every time you play. • A Feast for Killers - Dead by Daylight draws from all corners of the horror world. As a Killer you can play as anything from a powerful Slasher to terrifying paranormal entities. Familiarize yourself with your Killing Grounds and master each Killer’s unique power to be able to hunt, catch and sacrifice your victims. • Deeper and Deeper - Each Killer and Survivor has their own deep progression system and plenty of unlockables that can be customized to fit your own personal strategy. Experience, skills and understanding of the environment are key to being able to hunt or outwit the Killer. • Real People, Real Fear - The procedural levels and real human reactions to pure horror makes each game session an unexpected scenario. You will never be able to tell how it’s going to turn out. Ambience, music, and chilling environments combine into a terrifying experience. With enough time, you might even discover what’s hiding in the fog.

DayZ includes the original Chernarus terrain, and the Livonia terrain.; Chernarus - The iconic DayZ terrain, set in the post - soviet state of Chernarus and encompassing 230 km2 of hand - crafted environment based on real life locations.; Livonia - The dense 163 km2 map lets players experience the hardcore survival hit in a whole new environment. Players can put their survival skills to the test by venturing into the unfamiliar land of Livonia, and seeing just how long they can last in this deadlier - than - ever world.; Meet Others; Up to 60 players are struggling to survive by any means necessary at any given time. Make friends, kill on sight, build a base, or risk being betrayed over a can of tasty beans. Use VOIP to interact with other players however you see fit. Every encounter is meaningful when your life is always on the line. Be wary. Stay alert. Trust no one.; Survive Chernarus; The infected aren’t the only ones you need to worry about - there’s also the wildlife and elements. Evade packs of wolves and frenzied bears, find shelter from the punishing rain, search for light in the darkness of night. You’ll also need to master complex survival mechanics concerning your hunger, thirst, body temperature, and more.; Loot Up; Always make sure your gear is ready. Patch up damaged clothes, craft improvised items, and head out to deceptively dead cities to scavenge for valuable resources. Fix a car and hide it in your secret base under a cover of well - placed traps. Step into contaminated zones if you dare and keep your eyes peeled for precious loot. Don’t forget that you won’t get far without a full hazard suit and gas mask.; Take your Shot; Intense PvP action can break out anywhere at any time, especially in hotspots like abandoned military bases, where heart - pounding firefights are all the rage. Some survivors want your loot, others are simply hunting for sport. Then there are those who are afraid you’ll shoot first. Learn how to fight and know when the time has come to swallow your pride and flee. One bullet can change absolutely everything. Always watch your back.; Install Mods; Head on over to the Steam Workshop and find a customized server that fits. Join an active community of like - minded players and modify your DayZ experience to suit your taste. Browse thousands of fan - made features, maps, and guns - all of which are easily managed directly from the game launcher.; Enter Livonia; Teeming with wildlife, ruins, and hidden locations, Livonia offers 163 km2 of fields, forests, and mysterious landscape - a unique new experience that will appeal to newcomers and DayZ veterans alike.; Explore the Land; An exciting variety of undiscovered locations awaits the brave and adventurous. Explore murky swamps, abandoned hunting cabins, sawmills and deforested areas, as well as massive quarries containing stashes of leftover explosives.; Follow the bear; Livonia’s food supply is scarce. If you want to survive, you’ll have to learn how to hunt, fish, and forage in the unforgiving wilderness. Luckily, the land appears to be more alive now than it ever was before the apocalypse.; Discover the secret; Venture south and find the hidden entrance that leads to a mysterious underground complex. Make sure you’re with a friend while you look for a way in. And don’t forget to bring some supplies, especially a flashlight. Otherwise you might get lost in the darkened maze of corridors awaiting all who enter.","This is your Story; DayZ is a hardcore survival game where players must strive to endure a post - apocalyptic world populated by frenzied infected and other survivors. DayZ includes the original Chernarus terrain, and the Livonia terrain.; Chernarus - The iconic DayZ terrain, set in the post - soviet state of Chernarus and encompassing 230 km2 of hand - crafted environment based on real life locations.; Livonia - The dense 163 km2 map lets players experience the hardcore survival hit in a whole new environment. Players can put their survival skills to the test by venturing into the unfamiliar land of Livonia, and seeing just how long they can last in this deadlier - than - ever world.; Meet Others; Up to 60 players are struggling to survive by any means necessary at any given time. Make friends, kill on sight, build a base, or risk being betrayed over a can of tasty beans. Use VOIP to interact with other players however you see fit. Every encounter is meaningful when your life is always on the line. Be wary. Stay alert. Trust no one.; Survive Chernarus; The infected aren’t the only ones you need to worry about - there’s also the wildlife and elements. Evade packs of wolves and frenzied bears, find shelter from the punishing rain, search for light in the darkness of night. You’ll also need to master complex survival mechanics concerning your hunger, thirst, body temperature, and more.; Loot Up; Always make sure your gear is ready. Patch up damaged clothes, craft improvised items, and head out to deceptively dead cities to scavenge for valuable resources. Fix a car and hide it in your secret base under a cover of well - placed traps. Step into contaminated zones if you dare and keep your eyes peeled for precious loot. Don’t forget that you won’t get far without a full hazard suit and gas mask.; Take your Shot; Intense PvP action can break out anywhere at any time, especially in hotspots like abandoned military bases, where heart - pounding firefights are all the rage. Some survivors want your loot, others are simply hunting for sport. Then there are those who are afraid you’ll shoot first. Learn how to fight and know when the time has come to swallow your pride and flee. One bullet can change absolutely everything. Always watch your back.; Install Mods; Head on over to the Steam Workshop and find a customized server that fits. Join an active community of like - minded players and modify your DayZ experience to suit your taste. Browse thousands of fan - made features, maps, and guns - all of which are easily managed directly from the game launcher.; Enter Livonia; Teeming with wildlife, ruins, and hidden locations, Livonia offers 163 km2 of fields, forests, and mysterious landscape - a unique new experience that will appeal to newcomers and DayZ veterans alike.; Explore the Land; An exciting variety of undiscovered locations awaits the brave and adventurous. Explore murky swamps, abandoned hunting cabins, sawmills and deforested areas, as well as massive quarries containing stashes of leftover explosives.; Follow the bear; Livonia’s food supply is scarce. If you want to survive, you’ll have to learn how to hunt, fish, and forage in the unforgiving wilderness. Luckily, the land appears to be more alive now than it ever was before the apocalypse.; Discover the secret; Venture south and find the hidden entrance that leads to a mysterious underground complex. Make sure you’re with a friend while you look for a way in. And don’t forget to bring some supplies, especially a flashlight. Otherwise you might get lost in the darkened maze of corridors awaiting all who enter.","How long can you survive a post - apocalyptic world? A land overrun with an infected ""zombie"" population, where you compete with other survivors for limited resources. Will you team up with strangers and stay strong together? Or play as a lone wolf to avoid betrayal? This is DayZ - this is your story.","English, French, Italian, German, Spanish - Spain, Czech, Russian, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Japanese, Polish, Portuguese - Brazil","[110000000, 130000000, 150000000]","['Multi-player', 'MMO', 'PvP', 'Online PvP', 'Co-op', 'Online Co-op', 'Steam Achievements', 'Steam Workshop', 'Steam Cloud', 'Valve Anti-Cheat enabled']","['Action', 'Adventure', 'Massively Multiplayer']","['DayZReduxFinal', 'DayZ Final Trailer ESRB', 'DayZ Gameplay Trailer', 'DayZ Beta Launch Trailer']",13,"['Bodily Needs', 'Geared', 'Act of mercy', 'Field cook', ""I'm the firestarter"", 'Babyface', 'Natural instincts', 'Marksman', 'Pacify', 'Heal the world']",False,2018-12-13,24,,True,False,False,366464,Minimum:; OS: Windows 10 64 - bit; Processor: Intel Core i5 - 4430 or AMD Ryzen 5 2600 Six - Core; Memory: 8 GB RAM; Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 760 or AMD R9 270X; DirectX: Version 11; Storage: 25 GB available space; Sound Card: DirectX - compatible; Additional Notes: Internet connection,,,Recommended:; OS: Windows 10 / 11 64 - bit; Processor: Intel Core i5 - 6600K or AMD R5 1600X; Memory: 12 GB RAM; Graphics: NVIDIA GeForce GTX 1060 or AMD RX 580; DirectX: Version 11; Storage: 30 GB available space; Sound Card: DirectX - compatible; Additional Notes: Internet connection,,,"esrb: (required_age=17, descriptors=Intense Violence Blood) | pegi: (required_age=18, descriptors=Violence) | bbfc: (required_age=18, descriptors=) | usk: (required_age=18, descriptors=) | oflc: (required_age=15, descriptors=Strong themes and violence Online interactivity) | nzoflc: (required_age=18, descriptors=) | cero: (required_age=18, descriptors=) | kgrb: (required_age=18, descriptors=Expression of excessive violence Excessive vulgar, profanity and swear words Direct drug expression) | dejus: (required_age=18, descriptors=) | mda: (required_age=18, descriptors=) | fpb: (required_age=18, descriptors=) | csrr: (required_age=18, descriptors=) | crl: (required_age=18, descriptors=) | steam_germany: (required_age=18, descriptors=Gewalt)"

There are several storytellers to choose from. Randy Random does crazy stuff, Cassandra Classic goes for rising tension, and Phoebe Chillax likes to relax.; Your colonists are not professional settlers - they’re crash - landed survivors from a passenger liner destroyed in orbit. You can end up with a nobleman, an accountant, and a housewife. You’ll acquire more colonists by capturing them in combat and turning them to your side, buying them from slave traders, or taking in refugees. So your colony will always be a motley crew.; Each person’s background is tracked and affects how they play. A nobleman will be great at social skills (recruiting prisoners, negotiating trade prices), but refuse to do physical work. A farm oaf knows how to grow food by long experience, but cannot do research. A nerdy scientist is great at research, but cannot do social tasks at all. A genetically engineered assassin can do nothing but kill - but he does that very well.; Colonists develop - and destroy - relationships. Each has an opinion of the others, which determines whether they'll become lovers, marry, cheat, or fight. Perhaps your two best colonists are happily married - until one of them falls for the dashing surgeon who saved her from a gunshot wound.; The game generates a whole planet from pole to equator. You choose whether to land your crash pods in a cold northern tundra, a parched desert flat, a temperate forest, or a steaming equatorial jungle. Different areas have different animals, plants, diseases, temperatures, rainfall, mineral resources, and terrain. These challenges of surviving in a disease - infested, choking jungle are very different from those in a parched desert wasteland or a frozen tundra with a two - month growing season.; Travel across the planet. You're not stuck in one place. You can form a caravan of people, animals, and prisoners. Rescue kidnapped former allies from pirate outposts, attend peace talks, trade with other factions, attack enemy colonies, and complete other quests. You can even pack up your entire colony and move to a new place. You can use rocket - powered transport pods to travel faster.; You can tame and train animals. Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien - like lifeforms.; People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.; Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in - game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.; You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.; And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active modding community on the Steam Workshop.","RimWorld is a sci - fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller.

Lovable pets will cheer up sad colonists. Farm animals can be worked, milked, and sheared. Attack beasts can be released upon your enemies. There are many animals - cats, labrador retrievers, grizzly bears, camels, cougars, chinchillas, chickens, and exotic alien - like lifeforms.; People in RimWorld constantly observe their situation and surroundings in order to decide how to feel at any given moment. They respond to hunger and fatigue, witnessing death, disrespectfully unburied corpses, being wounded, being left in darkness, getting packed into cramped environments, sleeping outside or in the same room as others, and many other situations. If they're too stressed, they might lash out or break down.; Wounds, infections, prosthetics, and chronic conditions are tracked on each body part and affect characters' capacities. Eye injuries make it hard to shoot or do surgery. Wounded legs slow people down. Hands, brain, mouth, heart, liver, kidneys, stomach, feet, fingers, toes, and more can all be wounded, diseased, or missing, and all have logical in - game effects. And other species have their own body layouts - take off a deer's leg, and it can still hobble on the other three. Take off a rhino's horn, and it's much less dangerous.; You can repair body parts with prosthetics ranging from primitive to transcendent. A peg leg will get Joe Colonist walking after an unfortunate incident with a rhinoceros, but he'll still be quite slow. Buy an expensive bionic leg from a trader the next year, and Joe becomes a superhuman runner. You can even extract, sell, buy, and transplant internal organs.; And there's much more than that! The game is easy to mod and has an active modding community on the Steam Workshop.","A sci - fi colony sim driven by an intelligent AI storyteller.

Tames, which can continue to level - up and consume food, can also carry Inventory and Equipment such as Armor, carry prey back to your settlement depending on their strength, and larger tames can be ridden and directly controlled! Fly a Pterodactyl over the snow - capped mountains, lift allies over enemy walls, race through the jungle with a pack of Raptors, tromp through an enemy base along a gigantic brontosaurus, or chase down prey on the back of a raging T - Rex! Take part in a dynamic ecosystem life - cycle with its own predator & prey hierarchies, where you are just one creature among many species struggling for dominance and survival. Tames can also be mated with the opposite gender, to selectively breed successive generations using a trait system based on recombinant genetic inheritance. This process includes both egg - based incubation and mammalian gestation lifecycles! Or put more simply, raise babies!; ; You must eat and drink to survive, with different kinds of plants & meat having different nutritional properties, including human meat. Ensuring a supply of fresh water to your home and inventory is a pressing concern. All physical actions come at a cost of food and water, long - distance travel is fraught with subsistence peril! Inventory weight makes you move slower, and the day/night cycle along with randomized weather patterns add another layer of challenge by altering the temperature of the environment, causing you to hunger or thirst more quickly. Build a fire or shelter, and craft a large variety of customizable clothing & armors, to help protect yourself against locational damage & extreme temperatures using the dynamic indoor/outdoor insulation calculation system!; ; By chopping down forests full of trees and mining metal and other precious resources, you can craft the parts to build massive multi - leveled structures composed of complex snap - linked parts, including ramps, beams, pillars, windows, doors, gates, remote gates, trapdoors, water pipes, faucets, generators, wires and all manner of electrical devices, and ladders among many other types. Structures have a load system to fall apart if enough support has been destroyed, so reinforcing your buildings is important. All structures and items can be painted to customize the look of your home, as well as placing dynamically per - pixel paintable signs, textual billboards, and other decorative objects. Shelter reduces the extremes of weather and provides security for yourself and your stash! Weapons, clothing & armor gear can also be painted to express your own visual style.; ; Pick seeds from the wild vegetation around you, plant them in plots that you lay down, water them and nurture them with fertilizer (everything poops after consuming calories, which can then be composted, and some fertilizer is better than others). Tend to your crops and they will grow to produce delicious and rare fruits, which can also be used to cook a plethora of logical recipes and make useful tonics! Explore to find the rarest of plant seeds that have the most powerful properties! Vegetarians & vegans can flourish, and it will be possible to master and conquer the ARK in a non - violent manner!; ; By bringing sufficient rare sacrificial items to special Summon locations, you can capture the attention of the one of the ARK’s god - like mythical creatures, who will arrive for battle. These gargantuan monstrosities provide an end - game goal for the most experienced groups of players and their armies of tames, and will yield extremely valuable progression items if they are defeated.; ; Create a Tribe and add your friends to it, and all your tames can be commanded by and allied to anyone in your Tribe. Your Tribe will also be able to respawn at any of your home spawn points. Promote members to Tribe Admins to reduce the burden of management. Distribute key items and pass - codes to provide access your shared village!; ; All items are crafted from Blueprints that have variable statistics and qualities, and require corresponding resources. More remote and harsh locales across the ARK tend to have better resources, including the tallest mountains, darkest caves, and depths of the ocean! Level - Up your player character by gaining experience through performance actions, Level - Up your tames, and learn new ""Engrams"" to be able to craft Items from memory without the use of blueprints, even if you die! Customize the underlying physical look of your character with hair, eye, and skin tones, along with an array of body proportion modifiers. As you explore the vast ARK, you'll find clues left by other Survivors who have made the ARK their home in ages past, in the form of collectible detailed 3D ""Explorer Notes"". By uncovering all of these, you can begin to piece together the true nature of the ARK, and discover its purpose!; ; Everything you craft has durability and will wear - out from extended use if not repaired, and when you leave the game, your character remains sleeping in the persistent world. Your inventory physically exists in boxes or on your character in the world. Everything can be looted & stolen, so to achieve security you must build - up, team - up, or have tames to guard your stash. Death is permanent, and you can even knock out, capture, and force - feed other players to use them for your own purposes, such as extracting their blood to for transfusions, harvesting their fecal matter to use as fertilizer, or using them as food for your carnivorous tames!; ; The mysterious ARK is a formidable and imposing environment, composed of many natural and unnatural structures, above - ground, below - ground, and underwater. By fully exploring its secrets, you’ll find the most exotic procedurally randomized creatures and rare blueprints. Also to be found are Explorer Notes that are dynamically updated into the game, written by previous human denizens of the ARK from across the millennia, creatively detailing the creatures and backstory of the ARK and its creatures. Fully develop your in - game ARK - map through exploration, write custom points of interest onto it, and craft a Compass or GPS coordinates to aid exploring with other players, whom you can communicate with via proximity text & voice chat, or long - distance radio. Construct & draw in - game signs for other players to help them or lead them astray. . . And yet. . how do you ultimately challenge the Creators and Conquer the ARK? A definitive end - game is planned.; ; On the 100+ player servers, your character, everything you built, and your tames, stay in - game even when you leave. You can even physically travel your character and items between the network of ARK's by accessing the Obelisks and uploading (or downloading) your data from the Steam Economy! A galaxy of ARKs, each slightly different than the previous, to leave your mark on and conquer, one at a time - - special official ARKs will be unveiled on the World - map for limited times in singular themed events with corresponding limited - run items! Furthermore, you can now design or randomize your own unique 'Procedurally Generated ARKs', for infinite replayability and endless surprises.; ; You can play single - player local games, and bring your character and items between unofficial player - hosted servers, back and forth from singleplayer to multiplayer. Mod the game, with full Steam Workshop support and customized Unreal Engine 4 editor. See how we built our ARK using our maps and assets as an example. Host your own server and configure your ARK precisely to your liking. We want to see what you create!; ; The over - the - top hyper real imagery of the ARK its creatures is brought to expressive life using a highly - customized Unreal Engine 4, with fully dynamic lighting & global illumination, weather systems (rain, fog, snow, etc) & true - to - life volumetric cloud simulation, and the latest in advanced DirectX11 and DirectX12 rendering techniques.

Advanced new physics systems such as dynamic water so that every creature creates waves, ripples, splashes, and bubbles as they move through fluids, and fully interactive physical foliage where every blade of grass, bush, and tree reacts to characters, explosions, projectiles, and physics objects. Knock down a tree, and see it crash into other trees and disturb all the foliage on its way down to smacking into the grass below!
